# photo-indexer

photo-indexer aims to index photos in my laptop and external hard drive. It scans the given directories for photos, and extracts metadata of a photo like:
- Path
- Type (JPEG, PNG, etc)
- Width and heigth
- GPS (Lat and Lon)
- Created time

And it also collects tags and story of a photo from database, which are generated by [photo-viewer](https://github.com/archerwq/photo-viewer), then index all of them under a key (SHA1 of the photo bytes) in ElasticSearch.
